Unit Testing:

Understanding and implementing unit tests in Python demonstrates a commitment to code quality and reliability.
Test Driven Development (TDD):

If you've practiced TDD in Python, where tests are written before the actual code, emphasize your ability to follow this disciplined approach.
Testing APIs and Web Services:

If applicable, highlight experience in testing Python-based APIs or web services using frameworks like requests or tools like Postman.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
